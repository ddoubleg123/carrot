## üîç What We Need to Check on Vast.ai Server

### Connection Status
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **SSH connection seems to be failing** - Need to verify server is running

### If Server is Running, Check:
1. **Disk Space:** How much free space is available?
2. **Current Models:** What models are in HuggingFace cache?
3. **Installed Packages:** What Python packages are currently installed?
4. **Running Processes:** Is the old SD 1.5 API running?
5. **Available Scripts:** What files are already on the server?

---

## üöÄ Next Steps to Complete the Upgrade

### Step 1: Verify Vast.ai Server is Running
```bash
# Try to SSH in manually
ssh -p 14688 root@ssh4.vast.ai
```

If connection fails:
- Check if Vast.ai instance is still active
- Verify SSH port hasn't changed
- Check if instance needs to be restarted

### Step 2: Check Current Status
Once connected, run:
```bash
# Check disk space
df -h /

# Check what's installed
pip list | grep -E "torch|diffusers|transformers"

# Check what models exist
ls -la /root/.cache/huggingface/hub/

# Check running processes
ps aux | grep python
```

### Step 3: Upload Files
```powershell
# Run the deployment script
.\start-vast-sdxl-upgrade.ps1
```

Or manually:
```bash
scp -P 14688 vast-cleanup-sdxl-upgrade.sh root@ssh4.vast.ai:/root/
scp -P 14688 install-sdxl-packages.sh root@ssh4.vast.ai:/root/
scp -P 14688 upgraded-sdxl-api.py root@ssh4.vast.ai:/root/
```

### Step 4: Execute Upgrade on Server
SSH in and run:
```bash
# 1. Cleanup
chmod +x vast-cleanup-sdxl-upgrade.sh
./vast-cleanup-sdxl-upgrade.sh

# 2. Install packages
chmod +x install-sdxl-packages.sh
./install-sdxl-packages.sh

# 3. Start API
nohup python3 upgraded-sdxl-api.py > sdxl-api.log 2>&1 &
tail -f sdxl-api.log
```

### Step 5: Test
From local machine:
```bash
node test-upgraded-sdxl-api.js
```

## üéØ Estimated Current Server State

Based on your previous work, the server likely has:

### Likely Installed Already:
- ‚úÖ Python 3.x
- ‚úÖ PyTorch (possibly older version)
- ‚úÖ Some version of diffusers
- ‚úÖ FastAPI and uvicorn
- ‚úÖ SD 1.5 model (runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5)
- ‚úÖ Working SD 1.5 API (`working-sd-api.py`)

### Likely NOT Installed Yet:
- ‚ùå SDXL models
- ‚ùå Updated diffusers for SDXL
- ‚ùå basicsr / CodeFormer
- ‚ùå realesrgan
- ‚ùå Sufficient free disk space (~20GB needed)

### Current Disk Usage (Estimated):
- **Before cleanup:** Likely 90-100% full (40GB disk)
- **After cleanup:** Should reach 60-70% full
- **Needed:** ~20GB free for SDXL models and dependencies

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Blocker

**SSH Connection Issue:** The connection to `ssh4.vast.ai:14688` is failing or timing out.

### Possible Causes:
1. Vast.ai instance is stopped/paused
2. SSH port has changed
3. Instance was terminated and needs to be restarted
4. Network/firewall issue
5. Instance is rebooting

### How to Resolve:
1. Log into Vast.ai web interface
2. Check instance status
3. Verify SSH connection details
4. Restart instance if needed
5. Update connection details in scripts if port changed

## üéØ Summary

**THE PLAN IS COMPLETE ‚úÖ**  
**THE EXECUTION HAS NOT STARTED ‚ùå**

All preparation work is done. Now we need to:
1. Fix the SSH connection issue
2. Upload the files
3. Execute the upgrade steps
4. Test the results

Once the SSH connection is working, the entire upgrade will take approximately **40-50 minutes** to complete.

---

**Next Action:** Verify Vast.ai instance is running and SSH connection is working.
