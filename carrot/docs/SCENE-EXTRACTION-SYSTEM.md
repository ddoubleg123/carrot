**Status:** ✅ Production Ready

---

## Overview

The Scene-Aware Extraction System intelligently detects and extracts contextual details from image generation requests, enabling rich, detailed prompts that accurately represent complex scenes.

---

## What Gets Extracted

### 1. **Subjects** (WHO)
- Names of people in the scene
- Single subject vs dual subject detection
- Automatic deduplication

### 2. **Actions** (WHAT)
- Verbs: feeding, giving, teaching, healing, helping, addressing, distributing, speaking, performing, delivering, making, holding
- Captured with context

### 3. **Objects** (WITH WHAT)
- Items: fish, bread, loaves, food, crowd, people, audience
- Objects being held, distributed, or used

### 4. **Crowd Size** (HOW MANY)
- Numbers: "100 people", "5000 followers", "crowd"
- Used to determine wide-angle vs portrait composition

### 5. **Location** (WHERE)
- Phrases: "in front of", "at", "near", "inside", "beside", "on the shore of"
- Geographic details for background context

### 6. **Event Type** (CONTEXT)
- Events: rally, conference, summit, debate, meeting, press conference, ceremony
- Adds atmosphere (crowd, banners, signage)

## Extraction Examples

### Example 1: Jesus Christ Feeding 100 People

**Input:**
```json
{
  "title": "Jesus Christ",
  "summary": "Jesus Christ feeding 100 people with fish"
}
```

**Extracted:**
```json
{
  "names": ["Jesus Christ"],
  "mode": "single",
  "actionHint": "feeding",
  "objectHint": "fish",
  "countHint": "100 people",
  "locationHint": undefined,
  "eventHint": undefined
}
```

**Generated Prompt:**
```
Jesus Christ is clearly visible, feeding, holding or distributing fish, surrounded by 100 people, professional digital illustration, stylized art, clean lines, bold colors, dynamic composition, artistic storytelling, clear narrative focus, wide-angle view, 24–35mm lens, f/5.6, moderate depth of field, showing crowd and environment, professional quality, perfect composition, rule of thirds
```

---

### Example 2: Jesus Christ Political Speech

**Input:**
```json
{
  "title": "Jesus Christ",
  "summary": "Jesus Christ giving a political speech at a political rally in front of the Grand Canyon"
}
```

**Extracted:**
```json
{
  "names": ["Jesus Christ"],
  "mode": "single",
  "actionHint": "giving a political speech",
  "objectHint": undefined,
  "countHint": undefined,
  "locationHint": "in front of the Grand Canyon",
  "eventHint": "political rally"
}
```

**Generated Prompt:**
```
Jesus Christ is clearly visible, giving a political speech, in front of the Grand Canyon, with landscape details visible, political rally atmosphere with crowd, banners, signage, professional digital illustration, stylized art, clean lines, bold colors, dynamic composition, artistic storytelling, clear narrative focus, wide-angle view, 24–35mm lens, f/5.6, moderate depth of field, showing crowd and environment, professional quality, perfect composition, rule of thirds
```

### Example 3: Derrick Rose Portrait (No Context)

**Input:**
```json
{
  "title": "Derrick Rose",
  "summary": "Portrait of Derrick Rose"
}
```

**Extracted:**
```json
{
  "names": ["Derrick Rose"],
  "mode": "single",
  "actionHint": undefined,
  "objectHint": undefined,
  "countHint": undefined,
  "locationHint": undefined,
  "eventHint": undefined
}
```

**Generated Prompt:**
```
Derrick Rose is clearly visible, photorealistic, natural light, lifelike textures, realistic depth and shadow, portrait, 85mm lens look, f/1.4, shallow depth of field, centered composition, professional quality, perfect composition, rule of thirds
```

---

## Composition Logic

### Scene Detection

```typescript
const sceneDetected = Boolean(
  s.actionHint || 
  s.objectHint || 
  s.countHint || 
  s.locationHint || 
  s.eventHint
);
```

### Camera Selection

**Wide Scene (context detected):**
```
wide-angle view, 24–35mm lens, f/5.6, moderate depth of field, showing crowd and environment
```

**Portrait (no context):**
```
portrait, 85mm lens look, f/1.4, shallow depth of field, centered composition
```

---

## Regex Patterns

### Action Detection
```regex
/\b(feeding|giving|teaching|healing|helping|addressing|distributing|speaking|performing|delivering|making|holding)\b([^.,]+)/
```

### Object Detection
```regex
/\b(fish|bread|loaves|food|crowd|people|audience)\b/
```

### Crowd Size Detection
```regex
/\b(\d+)\s*(people|crowd|followers|men|women|children)?\b/
```

### Location Detection
```regex
/\b(in\s+front\s+of|at|near|inside|beside|on\s+the\s+shore\s+of)\s+([A-Za-z\s]+)/
```

### Event Detection
```regex
/\b(rally|conference|summit|debate|meeting|press\s+conference|ceremony|political\s+rally)\b/
```

---

## Deduplication Logic

### Problem: "Jesus Christ Jesus Christ"

**Before:**
```
names: ["Jesus Christ Jesus Christ"]
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Step 1: Split accidental doubles
const splitFixed = cleaned.flatMap(name => {
  const parts = name.split(/\b([A-Z][a-z]+(?:\s[A-Z][a-z]+)+)\b/g).filter(Boolean);
  return parts.map(p => p.trim());
});

// Step 2: Dedupe case-insensitively
const deduped = [...new Set(splitFixed.map(n => n.trim()))];

// Step 3: Normalize duplicate words
names = names.map(n => n.replace(/\b(\w+)\s+\1\b/g, '$1')).filter(Boolean);
```

**Result:**
```
names: ["Jesus Christ"]
```

---

## Style-Specific Behavior

### Photorealistic
```typescript
styleTokens = 'photorealistic, natural light, lifelike textures, realistic depth and shadow';
negative = NEGATIVE_PHOTOREALISTIC_SCENE;
```

### Illustration
```typescript
styleTokens = 'professional digital illustration, stylized art, clean lines, bold colors, dynamic composition, artistic storytelling, clear narrative focus';
negative = NEGATIVE_ILLUSTRATION;
```

---

## Negative Prompt Strategy

### Photorealistic Scenes
```
cartoon, anime, stylized, illustration, drawing, sketch, painting,
lowres, blurry, deformed hands, duplicate people, text artifacts,
halo, saint icon, crown of thorns, stained glass, mural, 
religious iconography, static portrait, centered headshot
```

### Illustration
```
photograph, photography, photorealistic, camera, lens, DSLR,
candid, snapshot, journalistic,
lowres, blurry, pixelated, duplicate people, text artifacts,
halo, crown of thorns, stained glass, mural, 
religious iconography, static portrait, centered headshot
```

**Key Exclusions:**
- ❌ Religious motifs (halo, crown, divine glow, stained glass)
- ❌ Static portrait/centered headshot (for scenes)
- ❌ Duplicate people
- ❌ Text artifacts

## Test Suite

### Test 1: Scene Extraction
```typescript
test('scene extraction: feeding 100 people with fish', () => {
  const s = sanitizeInputs('Jesus Christ', 'Jesus Christ feeding 100 people with fish');
  
  expect(s.names).toEqual(['Jesus Christ']);
  expect(s.actionHint).toBe('feeding');
  expect(s.objectHint).toBe('fish');
  expect(s.countHint).toBe('100 people');
});
```

### Test 2: Wide Scene Camera
```typescript
test('wide scene uses correct camera: 24-35mm for crowd scenes', () => {
  const s = sanitizeInputs('Jesus Christ', 'Jesus Christ feeding 100 people with fish');
  const { positive } = buildPrompt({ s });
  
  expect(positive).toMatch(/wide-angle view/);
  expect(positive).toMatch(/24–35mm/);
  expect(positive).not.toMatch(/85mm/);
});
```

### Test 3: Portrait Camera
```typescript
test('portrait uses correct camera: 85mm for single person', () => {
  const s = sanitizeInputs('Derrick Rose', 'Portrait of Derrick Rose');
  const { positive } = buildPrompt({ s });
  
  expect(positive).toMatch(/portrait/);
  expect(positive).toMatch(/85mm/);
  expect(positive).toMatch(/f\/1.4/);
});
```

### Test 4: Deduplication
```typescript
test('dedup: Jesus Christ Jesus Christ → Jesus Christ', () => {
  const s = sanitizeInputs('Jesus Christ Jesus Christ', 'Some summary');
  expect(s.names).toEqual(['Jesus Christ']);
});
```

## How It Works

### Flow Diagram
```
User Input (title, summary)
    ↓
extractUniqueNames(title + summary)
    → "Jesus Christ Jesus Christ" → ["Jesus Christ"]
    ↓
Extract Context (from summary):
    → actionHint: "feeding"
    → objectHint: "fish"
    → countHint: "100 people"
    → locationHint: undefined
    → eventHint: undefined
    ↓
Determine Scene Type:
    → sceneDetected = true (has action + object + count)
    ↓
Select Composition:
    → Wide scene: 24-35mm, f/5.6, show crowd
    ↓
Build Prompt:
    → Subject + Action + Object + Crowd + Location + Event
    → Style tokens (photorealistic / illustration)
    → Camera block (wide / portrait)
    ↓
Apply Negative Prompt:
    → Exclude: religious motifs, static portraits, duplicate people
```

## Acceptance Criteria ✅

- ✅ No duplicated subject names
- ✅ Contextual details (feeding, fish, 100 people) automatically detected and inserted
- ✅ For crowd/action scenes → uses wide shot, not portrait
- ✅ Halo/saint iconography prevented in negative prompts
- ✅ Works for both "illustration" and "photorealistic" modes
- ✅ All context hints logged for debugging

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Missing Context in Prompt

**Check:** Are the context hints being extracted?
```
[GenerateHeroImage] Sanitized: { actionHint: ..., objectHint: ..., countHint: ... }
```

**Solution:** Ensure summary contains detectable patterns:
- Action: "feeding", "giving", "speaking", etc.
- Object: "fish", "bread", "food", etc.
- Count: "100 people", "5000 followers", etc.

---

### Issue: Wrong Camera for Scene

**Check:** Is `sceneDetected` true?
```typescript
const sceneDetected = Boolean(s.actionHint || s.objectHint || s.countHint || s.locationHint || s.eventHint);
```

**Solution:** Ensure at least one context hint is extracted. If all are undefined, defaults to portrait.
