# 🔧 Build Error Fix - Chunk Loading

## 🐛 Current Error

```
GET /_next/static/chunks/app/(app)/patch/%5Bhandle%5D/page-d87c119a-9950ef47b15168fb.js 
net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (Not Found)

ChunkLoadError: Loading chunk 7660 failed
```

## 🔍 What This Means

This is a **stale chunk reference** error. The browser is trying to load a JavaScript chunk with an old hash that no longer exists on the server.

**Cause**: Build succeeded, but browser cached old chunk references OR build is still running.

---

## ✅ **Solution 1: Wait for Build to Complete**

The Render build might still be running. Check:

1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-...
2. Look for "Deploy in progress"
3. Wait for "Live ✓" status
4. Then hard refresh browser: `Ctrl + Shift + R`

---

## ✅ **Solution 2: Hard Refresh Browser**

The browser might have cached old chunk references:

```bash
# Windows/Linux
Ctrl + Shift + R

# Mac
Cmd + Shift + R
```

Or clear cache:
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click Refresh button
3. Click "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

---

## ✅ **Solution 3: Check Render Build Logs**

If build is failing, we need to see why:

1. Check last commit build status
2. Look for TypeScript errors
3. Look for missing imports

**Latest commit**: `6004735` - Should have fixed all TypeScript errors

---

## 🔍 **Verify Build Succeeded**

On Render dashboard, check for:

```
✓ Compiled successfully in 23.0s
Linting and checking validity of types ...
✓ No type errors found
✓ Build completed
```

If you see any errors, paste them here.

## 🚨 **If Build is Still Failing**

Check for:
1. Missing imports
2. TypeScript errors
3. Module not found errors

**Most likely issue**: Some component still importing deleted files

---

## 🔧 **Quick Fix Commands**

```bash
# 1. Check for imports of deleted files
cd carrot
grep -r "discovery-loop" src/
grep -r "discovery/redis" src/
grep -r "@/app/patch/\[handle\]/components/Discovery" src/

# 2. If found, fix import paths
# 3. Commit and push

# 4. Hard refresh browser after deploy
```

---

## ✅ **Most Likely Solution**

**Just wait 2-3 minutes** for Render to:
1. Finish building
2. Deploy new chunks
3. Then hard refresh your browser

The build logs show it was compiling successfully - just needs to complete!

---

**Try**: Hard refresh browser (Ctrl + Shift + R) in 2 minutes
