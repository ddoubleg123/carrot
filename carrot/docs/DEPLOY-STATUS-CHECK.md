# 🔍 Deployment Status Check

**Issue**: Browser showing chunk loading error  
**Most Likely Cause**: Build still in progress OR browser cache  

---

## ✅ **Quick Fix (Try This First)**

### **Step 1: Hard Refresh Browser**

```
Windows/Linux: Ctrl + Shift + R
Mac: Cmd + Shift + R
```

OR

1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click Refresh button
3. "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

**This solves 90% of chunk errors!**

---

## 🔍 **Step 2: Check Render Build Status**

Go to Render dashboard and verify:

### **✅ Build Should Show**:
```
✓ Compiled successfully in 23.0s
Linting and checking validity of types ...
✓ No type errors found
Creating optimized production build
✓ Build completed successfully
```

### **❌ If Build Shows Errors**:
Look for:
- TypeScript errors
- Module not found
- Import errors

**Latest fixes should have resolved all known errors**

## 📊 **Recent Commits**

All fixes deployed:

| Commit | Fix |
|--------|-----|
| `6004735` | ✅ Fixed DiscoveryCard prop name |
| `0c800b1` | ✅ Fixed imports after cleanup |
| `f8587d4` | ✅ Documentation |

**All TypeScript errors should be resolved**

---

## 🚨 **If Error Persists After Hard Refresh**

Check Render logs for actual build output:

### **Possible Issues**:

1. **Build still running** - Wait 2-3 more minutes
2. **Build failed** - Check logs for errors
3. **Cache issue** - Clear browser cache completely
4. **CDN issue** - Render's CDN may need time to propagate

---

## 🔧 **Emergency Rollback** (If Needed)

If the enhanced system is causing issues:

```bash
# Revert to before enhancements
git revert 6004735 0c800b1 4b7300f 4aeed71
git push

# Then investigate offline
```

**But**: This is very unlikely - changes were minimal and safe

---

## ✅ **Most Likely Resolution**

1. **Wait** 2-3 minutes for build to complete
2. **Hard refresh** browser (Ctrl + Shift + R)
3. **Test** discovery functionality

**The chunk error is almost always a timing/cache issue, not a code error.**

---

## 📝 **After It Works**

Test the enhanced discovery:
- [ ] Click "Start Discovery"
- [ ] Verify no duplicates
- [ ] Check batched logs in console
- [ ] Run discovery again - should skip duplicates

**Expected**: Clean, working discovery with no duplicate spam! ✨
