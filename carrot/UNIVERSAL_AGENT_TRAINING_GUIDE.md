## 🎯 **Best Practices for Agent Training**

### **1. Start with Specialty Workflows**
- Each agent has a specific expertise area
- Use the appropriate workflow for their domain
- This provides the foundational knowledge they need

### **2. Monitor Training Success**
- Check training tracker after each session
- Verify agent memories are being created
- Test their responses to domain-specific questions

### **3. Scale Training Across Agents**
- Use the same tracking system for all agents
- Compare training effectiveness across agents
- Identify which workflows work best

### **4. Customize Training Content**
- Add domain-specific content beyond the basic workflows
- Include recent developments in their field
- Add specialized knowledge areas

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**
- **Agent not found**: Use `--list-agents` to see available agents
- **Training failures**: Check API connectivity and agent status
- **No tracking data**: Ensure training records are being saved
- **502 errors**: The system now has better error handling and fallbacks

### **Debug Commands**
```bash
# Check if agents exist
node scripts/train-agent-workflow.js --list-agents

# Check training records
node scripts/training-tracker.js --list

# Check specific agent's current memories
# Go to /feed-agents and click "View Memories" on the agent's card
```

## 🎉 **You're Ready to Train Any Agent!**

### **Quick Start for Any Agent:**
1. **Choose Agent**: Pick any agent (Einstein, Keynes, Ada, Marie, MLK, Tesla)
2. **Train**: `node scripts/train-agent-workflow.js --agent "AGENT_NAME" --workflow "WORKFLOW_TYPE"`
3. **Track**: `node scripts/training-tracker.js --agent "AGENT_NAME"`
4. **View Results**: Go to `/feed-agents` and click "View Memories" on the agent's card
