# Fix: Next.js Trace File EPERM Error

## The Problem

```
Error: EPERM: operation not permitted, open '.next\trace'
```

This happens when:
- The `.next/trace` file is locked by another process
- Windows file permissions are preventing access
- Previous dev server didn't shut down cleanly

## Quick Fix (Manual)

### Option 1: Delete .next folder
```powershell
cd carrot
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .next
npm run dev
```

### Option 2: Use the fix script
```powershell
.\fix-trace-issue.ps1
```

This script:
1. Stops all Node processes
2. Deletes `.next` folder
3. Clears cache
4. Restarts dev server

## Permanent Solution

Add to `carrot/package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "cross-env PORT=3005 NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1 next dev",
    "dev:clean": "rimraf .next && cross-env PORT=3005 NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1 next dev"
  }
}
```

Then use `npm run dev:clean` when you encounter the issue.

## Prevention

1. **Always stop dev server cleanly**: Use `Ctrl+C` instead of closing terminal
2. **Close all terminals properly**: Don't force-close PowerShell windows
3. **One dev server at a time**: Check for existing Node processes before starting

## Check for Running Processes

```powershell
# List all Node processes
Get-Process -Name node

# Kill all Node processes (if needed)
Get-Process -Name node | Stop-Process -Force
```

## If Issue Persists

1. **Restart your computer** (clears all file locks)
2. **Check antivirus** (may be locking files)
3. **Run as administrator** (permission issues)
4. **Use WSL** (if on Windows, Linux subsystem avoids many Windows file issues)
