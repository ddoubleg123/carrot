## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Resource Requirements

**Disk Space:** ~25GB total
- SDXL models: 15GB
- SD v1.5 backup: ~5GB
- Working space: ~5GB

**VRAM:** ~20GB peak
- Idle with models loaded: ~16GB
- During generation: ~18-20GB
- Safe on 24GB GPUs only

**Time:** First run only
- Model download: 20-30 min (one-time)
- Subsequent runs: Instant (cached)

### Known Limitations

1. **GPU Requirement:** Needs 24GB VRAM
   - ✅ Works: RTX 3090, 4090
   - ❌ Doesn't work: RTX 3080 (10-12GB)

2. **Generation Time:** 2x slower than SD v1.5
   - Can optimize: Lower steps, reduce resolution
   - Trade-off: Speed vs quality

3. **Cost Impact:** ~2x cost per image
   - Same Vast.ai hourly rate
   - 2x generation time = 2x cost per image
   - Worth it for quality improvement

### Risk Mitigation

**Low Risk Deployment:**
1. ✅ **Automatic backups** - SD v1.5 preserved
2. ✅ **No destructive changes** - Can rollback
3. ✅ **Verification suite** - Catches issues
4. ✅ **Rollback script** - < 1 min to revert
5. ✅ **No code changes** - Application unchanged

**If Something Goes Wrong:**
- Run `./rollback-sdxl.sh`
- SD v1.5 restored in < 1 minute
- Zero data loss

## 📊 Expected Results

### Image Quality Comparison

**Prompt:** "Professional portrait of a basketball player"

**SD v1.5:**
- Resolution: 512x512
- Details: Moderate
- Face: Fair quality
- Time: ~8 seconds
- Size: 450KB

**SDXL:**
- Resolution: 1024x1024  ✨ **4x pixels**
- Details: High  ✨ **Much sharper**
- Face: Good quality  ✨ **Realistic features**
- Time: ~15 seconds  ⚠️ **Slower**
- Size: 1.5MB  ⚠️ **Larger**

**Verdict:** Quality improvement easily justifies the 2x time/cost increase.

---

## 🔄 Rollback Plan

If you need to revert to SD v1.5 for any reason:

```bash
# On Vast.ai instance
./rollback-sdxl.sh
```

**Rollback Process:**
1. Stops SDXL service
2. Restores SD v1.5 from backup
3. Starts SD v1.5 service
4. Verifies health

**Rollback Time:** < 1 minute  
**Data Loss:** None  
**Can Re-deploy:** Yes, anytime

## 💰 Cost Analysis

### Vast.ai Hosting
- **Current:** RTX 3090 Ti @ ~$0.40/hour
- **After SDXL:** Same hardware, same rate
- **No increase in hosting cost**

### Per-Image Cost
- **SD v1.5:** ~$0.001 per image (8s @ $0.40/hr)
- **SDXL:** ~$0.002 per image (15s @ $0.40/hr)
- **Increase:** 2x cost per image

### Monthly Impact (Example)
If generating 1,000 images/month:
- **SD v1.5:** ~$1.00/month
- **SDXL:** ~$2.00/month
- **Difference:** +$1.00/month

**Negligible cost increase, massive quality improvement.**
