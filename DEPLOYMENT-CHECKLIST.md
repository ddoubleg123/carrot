## üîß Required: Environment Variables on Render

The following environment variables **MUST** be set on your Render.com dashboard for the app to work correctly.

### How to Access:
1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Select your `carrot-app` service
3. Click on "Environment" in the left sidebar
4. Add/verify the following variables:

### Required Environment Variables:

#### 1. `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`
- **Purpose**: Used for content quality audit, summarization, and relevance checking
- **How to get**: Sign up at https://platform.deepseek.com and get your API key
- **Example**: `sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
- **Impact if missing**: 
  - ‚ùå Content summarization will fail
  - ‚ùå DeepSeek quality audit will not work
  - ‚ùå New discovered content will be rejected
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Fallback summaries will be used (poor quality)

#### 2. `NEXTAUTH_URL`
- **Purpose**: Base URL for internal API calls (hero generation, content preview)
- **Value**: `https://carrot-app.onrender.com`
- **Impact if missing**:
  - ‚ùå AI hero image generation will fail with "Invalid URL" errors
  - ‚ùå Wikimedia fallback will fail
  - ‚ùå All tiles will show SVG placeholders instead of images

#### 3. `VAST_AI_API_KEY` (if using AI image generation)
- **Purpose**: For SDXL AI image generation via Vast.ai
- **How to get**: Sign up at https://vast.ai and get your API key
- **Impact if missing**:
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è AI images won't generate (will fall back to Wikimedia)

#### 4. Other Required Variables (verify these exist):
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - For session management
- `FIREBASE_*` - Firebase credentials for storage

---

## üß™ Testing After Environment Variables Are Set

Once you've added the environment variables, you **MUST restart the service** on Render:

1. Go to your service dashboard
2. Click "Manual Deploy" ‚Üí "Clear build cache & deploy"
3. Wait for deployment to complete (~5-10 minutes)

### Then test the following:

#### Test 1: Discovery Process
1. Go to https://carrot-app.onrender.com/patch/chicago-bulls
2. Click "Start Discovery"
3. **Expected behavior**:
   - ‚úÖ New articles appear one at a time
   - ‚úÖ Each article has a hero image (AI or Wikimedia, not SVG placeholder)
   - ‚úÖ No infinite loops (same URL repeated)
   - ‚úÖ No hockey/NHL content appears
   - ‚úÖ Discovery stops after 10 items or moves to new sources
4. **Check console logs**:
   - ‚úÖ Should see "DeepSeek processed content" with quality/relevance scores
   - ‚úÖ Should see "AI generation attempt" or "Wikimedia fallback" for each item
   - ‚ùå Should NOT see "DeepSeek API failed: 403"
   - ‚ùå Should NOT see "Invalid URL" errors

#### Test 2: Content Modal
1. Click on any discovered content tile
2. **Expected behavior**:
   - ‚úÖ Modal opens with full content
   - ‚úÖ Hero image shows (not placeholder)
   - ‚úÖ Executive Summary is complete (not truncated)
   - ‚úÖ Key Facts are 5-8 clean facts
   - ‚úÖ "View Source" button works and opens the article
   - ‚úÖ URL bar shows unique URL like `/patch/chicago-bulls/content/{slug}`

#### Test 3: Content Quality
1. Open 3-5 different articles
2. **Expected behavior**:
   - ‚úÖ All content is Bulls-specific (no generic NBA)
   - ‚úÖ Summaries are in perfect English (no typos/grammar errors)
   - ‚úÖ Key facts are complete sentences (no "..." trailing)
   - ‚úÖ Relevance scores are ‚â• 70%

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Hero images still showing SVG placeholders"
**Cause**: `NEXTAUTH_URL` is missing or incorrect
**Fix**: 
1. Set `NEXTAUTH_URL=https://carrot-app.onrender.com`
2. Redeploy the service
3. Check logs for "AI generation attempt" messages

### Issue: "Discovery keeps finding the same URL"
**Cause**: Infinite loop (should be fixed now)
**Fix**: Already fixed in latest deployment. If it still happens, check logs for which candidate type is looping.

### Issue: "Content summaries are garbage text"
**Cause**: `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` is missing or invalid
**Fix**: 
1. Verify your DeepSeek API key is correct
2. Check you have credits remaining on your DeepSeek account
3. Look for "DeepSeek API failed: 403" in logs

### Issue: "Only 6 items showing even though 10 were discovered"
**Cause**: Already fixed - pagination limit increased to 50
**Fix**: Already deployed. Refresh the page to see all items.

## üìä Expected Console Logs (Good)

When everything is working correctly, you should see logs like this:

```
[Discovery Loop] ‚úÖ New URL found: https://example.com/bulls-article
[Enrich Content] ü§ñ Calling DeepSeek to summarize: Bulls Win Championship
[Enrich Content] ‚úÖ DeepSeek processed content:
[Enrich Content]    Quality Score: 85
[Enrich Content]    Relevance Score: 92
[Enrich Content]    Is Useful: true
[AI Hero Pipeline] üé® Attempting AI generation for: Bulls Win Championship
[AI Hero Pipeline] ‚úÖ AI hero generated: https://storage.googleapis.com/...
[Discovery Loop] ‚úÖ Item 1 saved. Continuing to next candidate...
```

## üî¥ Bad Console Logs (Errors)

If you see these, you have a problem:

```
‚ùå [Enrich Content] DeepSeek API failed: 403
   ‚Üí Missing or invalid DEEPSEEK_API_KEY

‚ùå [AI Hero Pipeline] Invalid URL
   ‚Üí Missing or incorrect NEXTAUTH_URL

‚ùå [Discovery Loop] ‚è≠Ô∏è  Skipping duplicate: https://sfgate.com/... (repeated 100 times)
   ‚Üí Infinite loop - should be fixed now

‚ùå [pickHero] No real media found, will use fallback
   ‚Üí Hero generation failed, check both env vars above
```

## ‚úÖ Final Checklist

Before considering the deployment complete, verify:

- [ ] `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` is set on Render
- [ ] `NEXTAUTH_URL` is set to `https://carrot-app.onrender.com`
- [ ] Service has been restarted after adding env vars
- [ ] Discovery process completes without errors
- [ ] All tiles show real images (not SVG placeholders)
- [ ] Content modals open with complete summaries
- [ ] No hockey/NHL content appears on Bulls page
- [ ] Discovery doesn't loop on the same URL
- [ ] All 10+ discovered items are visible

---

## üìù Notes

- The discovery process will now **automatically reject** low-quality or irrelevant content before saving
- DeepSeek scores content on **quality** (0-100) and **relevance** (0-100) and rejects anything below thresholds
- Hero images prioritize: **AI generated ‚Üí Wikimedia ‚Üí OG image ‚Üí placeholder**
- URL slugs are automatically generated for all new content
- The infinite loop fix prevents citation candidates from being reinserted when they fail

If you encounter any issues not covered here, check the Render logs for detailed error messages.
