## ⚠️ **Render is Building Wrong Commit**

**Problem**: Render is building `6e6fec5` but the fix is in `65c82e1`

**Solutions:**

### **Option 1: Wait for Next Webhook**
Render will automatically pick up `65c82e1` on the next deployment trigger (might take a few minutes)

### **Option 2: Manual Redeploy**
1. Go to Render dashboard
2. Your Carrot service
3. Click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"
4. It will pull `65c82e1`

### **Option 3: Force Webhook**
```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: trigger deployment"
git push
```
